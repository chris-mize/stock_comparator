    "When first cross-correlating the stocks, I don't return the arrays of the correlation signal and lags between them (that would be an insane amount of data). The point of this next bit is to perform the correlation again on the top correlating `n` number of stocks, but this time returning the full correlation array for that comparison. Additionally, we can set a minimum and maximum lag threshold (`lag_min` and `lag_max`, respectively), so that non-lagging stock combinations are ignored. Only combinations of stocks with lag values having an absolute value between `lag_min` and `lag_max` are kept. Finally, plot the top `plot_top` number of stocks into the results directory."
